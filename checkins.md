## Week 1 Summary (9/14/2025)

### This week I worked on:

[I began creating a game design document to hold my ideas for my project. I do not wish to begin building until my idea is greenlit. Once the project is approved, I will flesh out more specifics of this project and start its creation in Unity.]

### This week I learned:

[The scope of my project is larger than I originally anticipated. Creating a new idea in video games is rather difficult. Instead, I have chosen to combine multiple ideas into a combination which I have not yet seen.]

### My successes this week were:

[I was able to create a focused idea that I can build off of for the rest of the project's creation. A speed based boss rush is not an idea I have personally seen, so I am excited to see how it would work.]

### The challenges I faced this week were:

[Creating an idea for a game that is not too broad is difficult. My idea may not even be as focused as I think. I suppose I will find out after discussing it. Future problems will likely arise from the physics required for my game.]

## Week 2 Summary (09/22/2025)
### This week I worked on:

[I created a unity project and started creating basic shapes with probuilder that can be used for the arenas. During the next week, I plan to start on the basic controls and physics of the game. This will likely be more time consuming.]

### This week I learned:

[Taking Game Development II at the same time as this course will prove difficult. I am learning the techniques I need to create this game to the best of my ability during this process. Luckily I have most of the basics down.]

### My successes this week were:

[I successfully used Probuilder after learning it within the last week. More simplistic rectangular shapes do not cause many difficulties. Probuilder will be a huge help with map design.]

### The challenges I faced this week were:

[More spherical or rounded 3D objects can be difficult to use with Probuilder. More often than not, attempting to create these will create imperfect shapes. I was also unaware pf how to use materials in Probuilder until about an hour ago.]
