## Week 1 Summary (9/15/2025)

### This week I worked on:

[I began creating a game design document to hold my ideas for my project. I do not wish to begin building until my idea is greenlit. Once the project is approved, I will flesh out more specifics of this project and start its creation in Unity.]

### This week I learned:

[The scope of my project is larger than I originally anticipated. Creating a new idea in video games is rather difficult. Instead, I have chosen to combine multiple ideas into a combination which I have not yet seen.]

### My successes this week were:

[I was able to create a focused idea that I can build off of for the rest of the project's creation. A speed based boss rush is not an idea I have personally seen, so I am excited to see how it would work.]

### The challenges I faced this week were:

[Creating an idea for a game that is not too broad is difficult. My idea may not even be as focused as I think. I suppose I will find out after discussing it. Future problems will likely arise from the physics required for my game.]

## Week 2 Summary (09/22/2025)
### This week I worked on:

[I created a unity project and started creating basic shapes with probuilder that can be used for the arenas. During the next week, I plan to start on the basic controls and physics of the game. This will likely be more time consuming.]

### This week I learned:

[Taking Game Development II at the same time as this course will prove difficult. I am learning the techniques I need to create this game to the best of my ability during this process. Luckily I have most of the basics down.]

### My successes this week were:

[I successfully used Probuilder after learning it within the last week. More simplistic rectangular shapes do not cause many difficulties. Probuilder will be a huge help with map design.]

### The challenges I faced this week were:

[More spherical or rounded 3D objects can be difficult to use with Probuilder. More often than not, attempting to create these will create imperfect shapes. I was also unaware pf how to use materials in Probuilder until about an hour ago.]

## Week 3 Summary (09/29/2025)
### This week I worked on:

[I began working on the basic character movement in a three dimensional space. As each arena will be spherical, I must learn to create a movement system that is effected by curves. I was also able to create a functional spherical arena.]

### This week I learned:

[Movement in a three-dimensional space is much more difficult than a two-dimensional space. It is not just as simple as changig the Vector2 to a Vector3. More research must be done on my end.]

### My successes this week were:

[My character can move left and right. My spherical arena has the correct collision and is large enough to allow the player a large test space. I will use this to experiment with physics.]

### The challenges I faced this week were:

[I am mainly dealing with the difficulty of three-dimensional movement. My main other struggle comes from the texturing of the spherical arena. Lining up textures on a sphere has proven to be a pain.]

## Week 4 Summary (10/06/2025)
### This week I worked on:

[Basic three-dimensional movement, not including jumping is functional. Physics have not yet been added and jumping is not yet working.]

### This week I learned:

[Unity physics, especially when dealing with three dimensions will be a pain to code. Accounting for slopes and the character running up walls and ceilings will be a potential roadblock.]

### My successes this week were:

[MY character can move around some of the sperical arena I have created. Ramps have also been added to the arena to allow for more unique interaction with the world.]

### The challenges I faced this week were:

[Jumping is not yet working. I have only coded jumping in two-dimensional games, so there will be a slight difference there. However, the main problems will come from the rest of the physics implementation.]

---

## Week 5 Summary (10/13/2025)
### This week I worked on:

[I began implementing physics into player movement. Basic movement and jumping now include more momentum based physics. Gravity is more directly controlled by me.]

### This week I learned:

[The player material should be frictionless to ensure slope physics work as intended. I have not used a physics material for the player before. I should experiment with them not just on the player, but on other objects.]

### My successes this week were:

[Basic movement on slopes works almost as intended. The minor bugs seem easy to fix. The slopes I already created in my arena seem to work well with the physics.]

### The challenges I faced this week were:

[Ramps in the arena do not have consistent collision. More complex shapes will likely have this issue. Maybe models in the Unity Asset Store will not have that problem.]
