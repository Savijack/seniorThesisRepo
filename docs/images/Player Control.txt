Player Control

Jump - floaty or snappy?
Slide - increases rate of change of speed on slopes; downward greatly increases speed while upward greatly reduces it - togglable rather than held; arial version brings player down
Attack - different attacks based on speed of character; grounded attack launches higher with more speed; arial attack launches farther with more speed
Parry - timing is key; refills some health; reflects projectiles; gives temporary immunity to sedentary damage (damage by not moving)
Dodge - shifts velocity left or right (REMOVE THIS)
Drop Dash - arial method to give a burst of speed
Spindash - maybe make it like Celeria concept where it is more used to change the direction of already gained speed

Grounded attacks knock enemies up
Arial attacks keep enemies in combos

Combos - not necessarily a combo system; just chaining basic attacks to keep enemy in the air for easier damage; forces the player to move around
