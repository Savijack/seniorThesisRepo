Enemies and Bosses

General note: Make enemies pretty large to make it easier for the player to hit

Enemy Types:
- group of small enemies that needs to be defeating quickly one after the other or they respawn - quick movement - linked in some way

- shielded enemies (shields break with a certain amount of damage * speed) - mostly stationary - color indicates what speed level required; will match player color; one hit to break shield and one hit to kill; must be done in quick succession
	+ shield could be a separate game object connected to an enemy or boss; when it is destroyed, weak point is instantiated and if the shield is instantiated, weak point is destroyed
	+ make it to where multiple shields are needed to be destroyed for a weak point to instantiate

- basic cannon fodder - chase player; combo fodder

- enemies that block movement; example: wall of fire that damages the player running over or a genuine barrier - stationary

- projectile shooting foes necessary to bring player into the fray; turrets or something

- projectiles like fire that block the player and force them towards the center

Boss Types:
- First boss, main obstacle should be to movement
	+ does not move very much, basically a fortress in the center of the arena
	+ Unbreakable walls circling the shielded points
	+ 3 shielded points that player needs to build up speed to destroy
	+ mainly attempts to block player from gaining speed or using that gained speed
	+ phases increase layers of obstacles blocking shielded weak points
	+ hitting weak points creates indestructible walls around other points and removes all walls; pushes player out somehow to reform walls; expanding cylindrical collider

- Second boss, Clone of player - Nabbit type
	+ phases increase speed or add projectiles

- Third boss, Parry tester
	+ can the player parry
	+ only way to open weak point is by parrying
	+ incorporates projectile parrying in final phase; dead man's volley

Depending on development time make upgraded versions of these three bosses with more health, attacks, etc.

- Final boss should incorporate the first three bosses challenges to the player
	+ blocking the player
	+ evading the player
	+ forced parrying
	+ Keepy uppy like enemy comboing to finish the boss off and gain points
